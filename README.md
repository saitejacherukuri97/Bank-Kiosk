Bank Kiosk Application:

This project is a customer facing application which simulates the real world scenario for a kiosk. In this application, customer or a customer representative can easily access his/her account to perform basic bank operations such as Balance check, Cheque deposit, Transaction status, KYC Documents submission and Complaint logging. When an existing customer walks-in, he can just access his account using our facial recognition and when a customer representative enters, he can access the account using a unique QR-code sent to customers mobile and also if the person is not a customer then he/she can open an account within 90 seconds. For ease of process, there is also a customer support chatbot which will assist the users in their enquires. This application also focuses on gathering the customer responses in a unique way using facial emotion recognition.
